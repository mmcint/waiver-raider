# League Scoring Formats

Understanding your league scoring format is a critical aspect to building a winning team. There are 3 main scoring formats that a league can use to score players. Each values positions and players slightly differently. The three main scoring formats you'll hear about are *PPR*, *Half-point PPR*, and *Standard*. PPR, or point-per-reception, scoring gives a player 1 point per each reception. This is the most popular scoring format. The league I play in uses a PPR scoring format. Your league's scoring system can be found in the league information tab of the website of your choice. Below is my league's scoring information. We can use this information to create formulas for calculating fantasy points.
