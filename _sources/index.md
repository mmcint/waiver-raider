Welcome to Waiver Raiders! This blog is all about sharing practical, hands-on tutorials to help you dive into your own analytics for fantasy football. The name Waiver Raiders highlights the critical role of mastering the waiver wire—because success in fantasy football takes more than just a strong draft. It’s about making smart, informed moves throughout the season.

I’m not claiming to be an expert—or even particularly skilled—at fantasy football, but I am fascinated by the process of improving and finding an edge. In my league, everyone seems to follow the same podcasts and websites, so I’m exploring a different path. For me, the best way to learn is to roll up my sleeves and analyze the data myself. This blog is my way of experimenting, strategizing, and getting ready for a serious run at the 2025 championship.

My goal for 2025 is to provide a series of Jupyter Notebooks that deep into a specific fantasy football topics. Navigation for these notebooks is on the left side of the page.

Some of the topics I how to explore are:

* Where and how to get fantasy football statistics
* Understanding league scoring
* Key statistics for each position
* 2024 Post Mortem
* 2025 Do Not Draft List
* Creating predictions for 2025 players
* Prepping for draft day

Enjoy!
