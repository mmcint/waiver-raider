# Welcome to the Waiver Raiders Fantasy Football Analytics Blog

![waiver raiders](logo.png)

The purpose of this blog is to share practical tutorials for doing your own analytics in fantasy football. I don’t claim to be an expert—or even particularly good—at fantasy football, but I’m deeply curious about how to better prepare during the offseason to compete for a championship. In my league, everyone relies on the same podcasts and websites, so I want to take a different approach. For me, the best way to learn is by doing, and this blog is my way of diving deeper into the world of fantasy football to improve my strategies and gear up for the 2025 season.

My goal for 2025 is to provide one tutorial per week in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, diving deep into a specific fantasy football topic. Navigation for these notebooks is on the left side of the page.

Some of the topics I how to explore are:

* Where and how to get fantasy football statistics
* Understanding league scoring
* Key statistics for each position
* 2024 Post Mortem
* 2025 Do Not Draft List
* Creating predictions for 2025 players
* Prepping for draft day

Enjoy!
